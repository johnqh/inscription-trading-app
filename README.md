## Inscription Trading App Frontend
This frontend application is part of the Inscription Trading system, designed to interact with the Inscription Trading API. It provides a interface for trading inscriptions defined by the BRC-20 standard on a blockchain system. The application allows users to have a platform for trading inscriptionsâ€”assets encoded directly within the memos field of Bitcoin transactions, adhering to the BRC-20 standard. The application allows users to view, create, and manage orders and transactions efficiently.

## Installation and Running

NodeJS is required to install and run the API and order matching.

From a clone or archive of the repository, run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

A `.env` file will need to be made in order to store secrets, or else the API cannot communicate to the database or UniSat. The following variables are required:

```
DATABASE_URL=<url to mysql database>
API_KEY=<unisat api key>
EXCHANGE_WALLET=<exchange wallet for holding assets before order fulfillment>
```

1. Start the API:
2. Before starting the frontend, ensure that the API is running:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   This will start the API on port 3000 by default.
3. Run Order Matching:
4. Optionally, to handle order matching, execute:
   ```bash
   ts-node order_matching.ts
   ```
   It is recommended to automate this process with a cron job or similar scheduler.
5. Start the Frontend Application:
6. Once the API is up and running, you can start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

To run order matching, run `ts-node order_matching.ts`. It is recommended to run it with a cronjob or some other periodic scheduler.
